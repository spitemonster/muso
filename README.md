# muso

a bandcamp clone.

# history

i am an (easily bored/distracted) overachiever and ðŸ–• epic games. i am also maybe more behind on modern js development so would like a project to dig into to get me up to speed.

my primary motivator here is that i wish someone _would_ create an independent competitor to (the now corporate-and-partially-chinese-owned) bandcamp and services like spotify (which i still use, like we all do). i don't know what the business of that looks like (though almost certainly infeasible, buy music from independent retailers please) but i can imagine what the product itself looks like and how it functions. truth be told i have not thought far enough into this to have an exhaustive roadmap, but:

# roadmap

-   [ ] artist accounts
-   [ ] audio uploads and server-side audio conversion
-   [ ] search, tagging and recommendations for organic discovery
-   [ ] client-side streaming player

# license

whatever the MIT license is; do what you want. if you actually do something with this (unlikely) just let me know, would be interested to see.
